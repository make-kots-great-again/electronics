# LiquidCrystal_I2C_GY

For most I²C 1602/2004 Displays I recommend [This Library](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C/) instead.
This Library is written for the GY-IICLCD I²C Driver, works with both 1602 and 2004 LCDs. Module defaults to I²C Address 0x20, but supports Address range 0x20-0x27.
